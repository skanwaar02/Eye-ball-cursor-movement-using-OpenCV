# Eye-ball-cursor-movement-using-OpenCV
This project aimed to create a hands-free cursor control system by tracking the movement of the user's eyes using computer vision. By utilizing the OpenCV library in Python, the project implemented real-time eye-tracking to detect the position of the user's pupils and translated this movement into corresponding cursor movements on the screen.

**Key Features:**
Developed an efficient eye detection algorithm using OpenCVâ€™s Haar Cascade classifiers to identify and track the user's eye region in real-time.
Implemented image processing techniques to locate the iris/pupil position, which controls the cursor movement.
Designed the system to assist users with physical disabilities by providing an alternative, non-invasive way to interact with their computers.
