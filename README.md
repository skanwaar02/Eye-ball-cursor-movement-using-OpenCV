# Eye-ball-cursor-movement-using-OpenCV
This project aimed to create a hands-free cursor control system by tracking the movement of the user's eyes using computer vision. By utilizing the OpenCV library in Python, the project implemented real-time eye-tracking to detect the position of the user's pupils and translated this movement into corresponding cursor movements on the screen.
